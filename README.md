An algorithm that looks at potential wins and loses for the National Basketball Association.

The algorithm makes use of a Twitter sentiment analysis bot that counts the positive responses, negative responses, and neutral reponses of a sports team for an upcomming game.  To access this twitter sentiment analysis bot, you have to have a developer account with the proper keys put into the cell in the correct location.  Furthermore, you have to specify which team you're looking to scrape twitter for, otherwise it will scrape for the same teams every time.  

The other feature of predicting the game winner makes use of the bootstrap method of an existing github repository, minimizing the code in the cell, giving a prediction, and reponding back with probability of each team winning and a projected final score.
